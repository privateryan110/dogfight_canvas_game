# Dogfighting Game
Two player dogfighting game. 

Bullets ricochet off of one wall. 

Every time a player gets hit, resets the position of both players and the screen turns the color of the player who won. 

##Control

Blue controlled with the arrow keys, up being forward, down being backwards with the side arrows stearing. Blue shoots with the Comma key 
Red is controlled similarly with WASD and shoots with the space bar.
